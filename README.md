## [Rockband Rivals mode FAQ](https://rockbandrivalsfaq.github.io)

This is an FAQ of the Rivals competitive mode for the Harmonix console game RockBand. It is focussed on how to play rather than a history of the mode. 

I started this FAQ because I was frustrated at how thinly this mode is documented. A lot of the information here comes via the good folks at [/r/Rockband]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockband/)

See the end of the file on how to contribute additions or corrections. Anything in italics or annotated with _(not sure)_ is something that may very well be innacurate and needs confirmation.

## The game

To play, you either have to have Rockband 4 and then buy the Rivals expansion, or you can buy both as a bundle.  

The game is available on PS4 or Xbox One. 

### The competition

Rivals is a clan-type competition with players joining a **Crew** (using their PSN ID). It is the Crew that competes in Rivals Mode but rewards go to individual players. 

### Crews

A Crew can consist of up to 10 players (PSN IDs). While a Code of Conduct is yet to be published by Harmonix, discussions on reddit strongly imply that having more that 10 people in your crew (eg. by allowing a PSN ID to be shared) is considered cheating. 

You can play in a Crew of 1 if you are so inclined, but it will be hard to compete at the top tier by yourself.

### What is the point?

To have fun playing RB while challenging yourself and cheering your crewmates on. 

Oh, you mean specifically. There are essentially two things you can compete for:

- Season Points define your overall position in the competition. The crew with the most Season Points wins (but see [Ties](#ties)

### Season and Challenge

The competition cycle is called a **"Season"**. A Rivals Season is consists of eight weekly **Challenges.**

Generally there is a week between seasons with no challenges, though it can be otherwise (for example there was a 2-week gap break over the 2017 Christmas holiday). 

### When does a weekly Challenge start/end?

Challenges start at 15:00 in the US East Coast time on Thursdays, and end midnight (same timezone) on Tuesday night.

_Timezone-wise that is EDT in the winter and EST in the summer_ or if you are confused, in whatever time it is in New York City.

That makes it a 39 hour gap between challenges. 

## Gameplay: Spotlight Songs

### If you played a Spotlight Song and the score didn't count

You can only post a Spotlight Score for one crew during any one Challenge. So if you are 

- a member of Crew A
- play a Spotlight song _(not sure - do you have to have played a spotlight song? posted a spotlight score? or just have belonged in a different crew)_
- leave Crew A and join Crew B
- play a Spotlight Song

... your score won't post for Crew B's Spotlight. You can still earn XP for Crew B though. 

## Bugs / Limitations / Weirdnesses

### Online play

Not specific to Rivals, but because currently online play only supports one player at each console, it is not possible for a crew to play online together if some of them live in the same household and some are remote. 

### Ties

If two crews tie in Seasonal Points the tie-breaker seems to be a behind-the-scenes numeric identifier for the crews. Hence if Crew A and Crew B always end the Season in a tie for the top two positions, the same crew will always be the winner.
